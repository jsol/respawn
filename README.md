# Respawn

The engine/ folder should contain all game logic, ui/ an ui implementation with Raylib.

The idea is that a websocket communication layer should be added for a webui implementation as well.

See which parts can be built as wasm and which should be implemented in js.

## WIP

Everything is basically still work-in-progress.
